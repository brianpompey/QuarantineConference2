Welcome to the Quarantine Conference App!

As most (if not all) tech conferences this year have been either indefintely postponed,
cancelled or reorganized as virtual, it's a pretty hard time for people who were really
looking forward to getting out there, networking, finding their first or new job, and 
just getting to spend some free time around like minded people. I know I'm one of them!

This site focuses on those conferences that decided to reorganize to virtual.
It can be difficult to get everyone's attention and let them know the details of a virtual conference.
I know I have a hard time keeping up.
So this site will be a central location where all organizers can post their conference info, all 
users can register and be noticed by the organizations, and together we can try to make this all work.

Admins of the site have the backdoor permissions to add conferences, view user info, and everything between.
